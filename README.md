AdStat is the best app to track your ads earnings!

The application is intended for developers or advertisers. This is a safe and secure way to view your ads earnings. It
uses Google's secure login and does not save your password or any personal information. You can perform simple data
analysis and view it in simple reports and charts.

Functions – Supported data sources from the AdMob Reports API.

- Earnings reports for today, yesterday, this week, last month and for any selected period
- Application and banner reports
- Income charts
- Dark mode
- Different currencies

IMPORTANT: This is NOT an official AdMob viewer app. But it uses the official API for both sources of income. Please
compare the data in this app with yours and report any issue you see.
